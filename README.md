## F1 Standings

A React web application designed to keep track of  this seasons Driver and Constructors championship standings.

To retrieve the data, the Motor Racing Developer API by Ergast was used. The data was then retrieved using React Query to display each championship in a intuitive format.

The Web Application was built using Bootstrap and is responsive on all devices.
